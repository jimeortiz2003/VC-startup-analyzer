- Optional: Build a user-friendly dashboard using Streamlit

## Key Features
- Python-based data wrangling and EDA
- Scoring model: `VC Fit Score`
- Industry filters, stage segmentation, and ranking
- Optional Tableau/Streamlit interface for interactive exploration

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning and transformation (pandas, numpy)
- Visualization (matplotlib, seaborn, plotly)
- Scoring logic and model thinking
- Understanding of VC evaluation metrics
- Optional: dashboard design with Streamlit
